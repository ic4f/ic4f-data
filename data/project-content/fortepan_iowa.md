Fortepan Iowa is a web-based curated archive of amateur photos of Iowan life, taken over the past
100+ years. The project is a multidiscilinary colaborative effort by faculty at the University of
Northern Iowa: Bettina Fabos, Leisl Carr Childers, Noah Doley, Jaycie Vos, and myself.

I am solely responsible for developing the software that runs the archive: the public website, the
archive admin website, and the upcoming new version's API), as well as a variety of data/file
processing scripts used to manage the archive on the back end. I also administer the production and
staging servers that host the archive.

The current live version is available at <a href="http://fortepan.us" target="_blank">http://fortepan.us</a>

A new version is being developed, expected to be launched this summer. Current (partially complete) demo version 
<a href="http://sergey.cs.uni.edu/kronofoto/public/collections" target="_blank">is available here</a>.
