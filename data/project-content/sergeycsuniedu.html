This is <a href="http://sergey.cs.uni.edu" target="_blank">my academic website</a>. It's one of the
quirky experimental programs that live on Deepthought - a server I got for my start up money at
UNI and have been administering ever since. The website is run by a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ic4f/sergey.cs.uni.edu/blob/master/www/app.php">front controller</a> 
that handles routing, initializes a few variables, then loads and populates a template file. The
content is organized using physical directories - which is the way I want it for this site. There's
also 
<a href="https://github.com/ic4f/sergey.cs.uni.edu/blob/master/utils/make_schedule.py" target="_blank">a neat 
Python script</a> that generates the HTML for my course schedule web pages (see screenshot) - 
it simplifies my life at the beginning of each semester.
