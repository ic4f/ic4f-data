**kronofoto-ng** is an Angular-based front-end for the <a href="http://fortepan.us" target="_blank">Fortepan Iowa</a> digital archive. It is part of
Kronofoto, an umbrella term for three loosely coupled applications built to host and manage a
digital archive like Fortepan Iowa:

* kronofoto-ng (public front-end)
* kronofoto-api (API consumed by a web-based front-end)
* kronofoto-admin (web-based archive management system)

Although built for Fortepan Iowa, Kronofoto is designed to be (mostly) collection-agnostic and can
be adapted to similar collections.

**Expected Release.** Currently, kronofoto-ng is approaching an alpha release. It's operational
(<a href="http://sergey.cs.uni.edu/kronofoto/public/collections" target="_blank">current demo version available here</a>). 
Here's what I'm working on at the moment: 
* pan and scan with SeaDragon
* Google Maps integration
* a richer search/browsing UI
* ...and a stream of items from an infinite todo list
