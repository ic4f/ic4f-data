This is <a href="http://alinaavanesyan.com" target="_blank">Alina's website</a>. It's generated by
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> - an easy-to-use and flexible static site
generator. The site has quite a bit of content, but most of it can be manipulated with scripts, so
there's minimum repetition of code or effort. 

**What's cool**  
(1) Like any scientist, Alina has a considerable list of publications, conference talks, etc.,
structured as an hierarchy. Displaying this structure on one page is simple. However, each item
is related to a research project or a course Alina has taught, or both. That project or course
has its own page on the site, and it makes sense to display relevant publications on that page - 
which leads to multiple subsets of the publication list. Furthermore, the master list changes: 
new publications are added, "submitted" move to "published", etc. Making such edits manually is not
a good idea.

So I <a href="https://github.com/ic4f/alina/blob/master/_plugins/pub_tag.rb" target="_blank">wrote a
plugin</a> and learned some Ruby in the process. The plugin 
<a href="https://github.com/ic4f/alina/blob/master/_data/publications.yml" target="_blank">reads in the
list stored in YAML</a>, and displays the full list or its relevant subset - depending on the
project. 

(2) Modals for most photos are handled by 
<a href="https://github.com/ic4f/alina/blob/master/assets/js/modals.js" target="_blank">this simple jQuery script</a>.
