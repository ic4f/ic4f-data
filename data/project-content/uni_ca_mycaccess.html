MyCAccess was a summer program website for Camp Adventure. It was a restricted site, limited to
participating students, their parents, and staff members. The website functioned as an online
community for participants and a community/program management portal for staff. Community features
included calendars, personal tasks and reminders; group and individual messages, news and events,
and a discussion forum. The program included multiple location sites, so the security model used
fine-grained authorization: access privileges for system features were assigned based on user
type/role and program site location.  <div class="screenshots row">
