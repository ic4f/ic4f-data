This website was similar to MyCAccess. It was a restricted community for IYC-2003 - a summer program
that brought groups of highschool students from 10 european locations to spend two weeks at the
University of Northern Iowa. Most of the features and overall system architecture were similar to
MyCAccess, with the addition of simple personal web pages, personal journals and photo albums.
