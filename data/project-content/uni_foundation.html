<p>This was one of my last .NET-based content management systems and, possibly, the most feature-rich.
It included a content library (file manager and misc. content elements organized into categories +
tags); public site and admin site menus and pages organized hierarchically; and a variety of content
types - colleges, departments, degree programs, news, faculty and staff listings. It used an
authentication model with fine-grained authorization (view/modify/publish permissions assigned by
user role and by admin site area/content type.</p>

<p>I also wrote a <a href="/static/projects/uni_foundation/manual.pdf" target="_blank">35-page system manual</a> 
for site administrators.  The manual describes what the system does in detail. The introduction to
the manual provides an overview of the scope of the system:</p>

<div class="long-quote">
  <p>A web site can be described as a collection of web pages, containing text and multimedia, which are
  linked to each other through hyperlinks, and are organized according to an hierarchical structure.
  The hierarchy is represented by the website’s menu.</p>

  <p>The content management system you are using provides a way to manage these pages, the content they
  contain, the links between them and additional content, and their position within the website’s
  hierarchy. You can create pages, add text and multimedia to their content, link them to other pages,
  and assign them to related items, such as website menus, content to be displayed on the right-side
  bar, categories, labels, etc. In addition to pages, you can manage the content which may be included
  in pages, such as files and images; manage additional content items, such as quotes, sidebar
  modules, header images, etc. The system helps you manage this content and protects you from breaking
  dependencies between content items, which lead to broken links and non-functioning websites.</p>
