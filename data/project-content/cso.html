Online store/shopping cart; website with content management system. Content management included
products, product categories and groups, sizes, colors, offers, coupons, discounts, misc. content
elements, product inventory, customers, auto-emails, and authentication/authorization model with
users, roles and permissions. It was initially build in classic ASP, later partially rebuilt in C#
due to the need for rather complex sales reports, implementing which in VBScript was unreasonable.
